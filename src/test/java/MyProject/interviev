FRAMEWORK
• In my framework, I was developing my testing code using JavaScript programming language and Protractor.
• I used Jasmine to manage and centralize my dependencies which I have pom.xml
• My framework was structured based on the POM that every page element go to one class and it makes easy to
maintenance and to keep my code organized and clean.
o Also, I have separate classes where I keep my implemented step ...
o I created other separate folders for my drivers, for my runners and for my useful methods.
• My framework supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and scenario outline.
• I am using Jira as bug tracking tool.
• And I achieve continuous integration and schedule my tests using Jenkins. (I accomplished X THING, by doing Y THING,
and achieved Z MEASURABLE RESULT)
• Nice little touch: achievement during this project, that really helped me grow as an automation tester, was that I
discovered ISSUE X, did ACTION Y, and then measurable result Z happened.

. What are the advantages of Selenium?

• It supports multiple languages like Java, Ruby, Python, C#...
• It supports multi-browser testing
• It has a good amount of resources and helping community
• It supports many operating systems like Windows, Mac, Linux ...
• Interact with the web application

. What are the limitations of Selenium?
• We cannot test desktop application
• We cannot test web services
• Ewe have to use external libraries and tools for performing tasks like testing framework (TestNG, JUnit), reading from
external files (Apache POI for excel)
• Automating Captcha is not possible using Selenium
• It does not support file upload facility.

. What are the disadvantages of Selenium?
• Selenium supports only web-based applications, does not support windows-based application
• No built-in reporting tool, it needs third party tools for report generation activity
• Cannot work with graphics, captchas, barcodes, shapes
• It does not support file upload facility.
• Hard to master, requires developer level knowledge
• Hard to write good locators
• Hard to synchronize
